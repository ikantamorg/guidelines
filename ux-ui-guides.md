# UI/UX Notes

Improvments based on Material Design Principles

## Responsive interaction [Demo](http://codepen.io/ElmahdiMahmoud/full/gabXBW/)

**Surface reaction:** from the point of input (the contact point of a fingere), make the visual reaction *touch ripple*.


## Writing

### Language

**Speak to the user as “you”**

Speak directly to users as “you,” not “me.” Don’t put words in the users’ mouths, with phrases that use “I” or “my.”

Exceptions include:
* Some legal opt-ins: “I agree to...”
* Some categories, such as "My music" or "My books"

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Your account  | My account  |


**Don’t refer to “we”**

Rewrite to focus on the user and what they can do with your app, rather than what you or your app is doing for the user.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Get started with these popular items on AptDeco.  | To get you started, we’re showing you popular items on AptDeco.  |
| You can delete your AptDeco profile using this page.  | This page allows you to delete your AptDeco profile.  |

One exception is when a human (not software) actually does take action for a user, such as reviewing an appeal or responding to a suggestion. Here, the use of “we” is appropriate and much more personable than the forced passive alternative.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| We’ll review your appeal and respond within a few days. | Your appeal will be reviewed, and you will receive a response within a few days.  |


**Be concise**

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Read the instructions that came with your phone. | Consult the documentation that came with your phone for further instructions.  |


**Use simple word forms**

Use active verbs (“the dog bit the tree”) not passive verbs (“the tree was bitten”), except when the passive is shorter and simpler (“tree bitten”) or when there is no clear subject.

**Try to write in the present**

Most UI happens now, so you can write in the present.

When you need to write in the past or future, use simple verb forms.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Message sent | Message has been sent |

**Write simply and directly**

It’s easier for users to scan and understand simple, direct language as they skim through an interface.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Save changes? | Would you like to save your changes? |

**Use simple words that everyone knows**

When choosing among synonyms, pick the simplest word.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Turn on Location History | Enable Location History |

**Omit unnecessary phrases**

You can skip many common introductory phrases and get right to the point.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Delete this photo? | Are you sure you want to delete this photo? |
| Want to… | Do you want to… |

**Use consistent verbs across the arc of an action**

The framing concept of an action is typically a verb. Pick one and use it consistently across the micro-narrative of an action.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Delete this photo? | Are you sure you want to delete this photo? |
| Remove photo? | Delete photo |
| Remove photo? | Remove photo from page? |
| Cancel/ Remove | Cancel/ OK |

### Capitalization & punctuation

**Use sentence-style caps**

Use sentence-style caps for all titles, headings, labels, menu items — any place where you might be tempted to use “Title-Style Caps.”

Avoid ALL-CAPS except where the material spec requires them, for example, the Button style.

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| Search settings | Search Settings |
| Search settings | SEARCH SETTINGS |

**“1, 2, 3” not “one, two, three”**

“1, 2, 3” not “one, two, three”
Use numerals in place of words for numbers.
One exception is when mixing uses of numbers: "Enter two 3s."

| Do.  | Don't.  |
|------|---------|
| You have 3 messages | You have three messages |
